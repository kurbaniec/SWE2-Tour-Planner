### Encountered Problems

#### Responsive Design

WrapPanel with two Grids (that stretch to infinite)

Force Wrapping via `WidthConverter`

#### Scrolling

Logs are Listviews with an internal Scrollviewer by default. This Scrollviewer can be removed.

See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11451793/12347616

Also DataGrids have a scroller...

#### DataGrid

Bind one item to DataGrid? Solution: ItemSourceConverter, returns a plain list!.
